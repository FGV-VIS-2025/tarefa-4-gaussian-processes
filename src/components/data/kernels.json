        "Name": "RBF",
        "Description": "The RBF kernel is a stationary kernel. It is parameterized by a positive length-scale parameter, which can either be a scalar (isotropic kernel) or a vector with the same number of dimensions as the input (anisotropic kernel). ",

        "Name": "Matern",
        "Description": "The Mat√©rn kernel is a generalization of the RBF kernel, and also stationary. Besides the lenght-scale parameter (which can be a scalar or a vector, like for the RBF), it has an additional parameter which controls the smoothness of the resulting function.",
        "Formula": "k(x_i, x_j) = \\exp \\Bigg(- \\frac{1}{l} d(x_i , x_j ) \\Bigg) \\quad \\quad \\nu= \tfrac{1}{2}"

        "Name": "Periodic",
        "Description": "The periodic kernel allows one to model functions which repeat themselves exactly. It is parameterized by a length-scale parameter and a period parameter.",

        "Name": "Polynomial",
        "Description": "The polynomial kernel is often used to represent the similarity between two points in a higher dimensional (often feature) space. It has two parameters: d and c, which control the scaling and offset of the polynomial, respectively.",
        "Formula": "k(x_i, x_j) = (\\alpha x_i^T x_j + c)^d"
